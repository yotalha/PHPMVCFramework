# PHPMVCFramework
implementing php framework from scratch

Assignment: (Deadline - 10 hours)
We are assuming that you have created a project containing the MVC structure explained in
the tutorial video. Now, you have to extend your project with the following changes.
1. You have to create a sign up & sign in feature for Students & Teachers. (All validations
should be handled)
2. When a Teacher is signed in, he will be able to add courses with time. Like Mr. Ali teaches
three subjects (DataScience 8:00 AM - 10:00 AM), (Automata 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM) &
(Calculus 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM). The time duration of the courses shouldnâ€™t conflict.
3. When a Student is signed in, he will be able to join any course from any teacher.
4. Students will not be able to add two subjects with the same time duration. Like if the
timing of the DataScience course from Mr. Ali is 8:00AM-10AM and the timing of the
Calculus course from Mr. Ahmad is 9AM-11AM, he will not be able to join both courses
at the same time.
NOTE: Please check all the validations with AJAX calls.
